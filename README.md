# wafa-rh-FileCreator
  This Python script demonstrates file management operations. It checks if a file named “file.txt” exists. If not, it gives the user the option to create the file. Then, it allows the user to write or append text to the file based on their choice.

  Feel free to customize and enhance this script further!
